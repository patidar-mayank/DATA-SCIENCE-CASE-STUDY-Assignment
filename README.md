# DATA-SCIENCE-CASE-STUDY-Assignment

*  This project aims to predict the overall rating of beers using various features from a beer review dataset. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the overall rating of beer based on multiple features, such as beer style, appearance, aroma, taste, and review text.

Tasks
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and clean review text.
* Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from text and other columns.
* Model Building: Build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the overall beer rating.
* Model Evaluation: Use multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, RÂ² score) to compare model performance.
